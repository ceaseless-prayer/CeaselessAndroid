# Ceaseless for Android
The Ceaseless Prayer app for Android will be built with React Native.

# Android Setup

Follow the [Android Setup](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html) instructions.
You may want to install [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html) which will
handle some of these things for you.

# Working on the app

Coming soon.

# Running in the emulator

Make sure you have the tools directory for the Android SDK in your path, e.g. `/Users/your-user-name/Library/Android/sdk/tools`.

* Run the Android Virutal Device Manager: `android avd`
* Run your Android virtual device (you should have created one via Android Setup directions linked above)
* In your React Native project, when your virtual device is ready, run `react-native run-android`
